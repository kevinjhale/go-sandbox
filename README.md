Practicing go

This is a blank project for practicing go projects. The inidividual practice projects are all done and stored within their own branch. i.e. `tutorials/greetings`

To do your own tutorial, make a new branch `tutorials/{your-branch-name}` and begin with `go mod init {your-branch-name}`
